The code you provided is written in VBScript. It defines a class named `aspJSON`, which appears to be a JSON parsing and encoding utility. This class is designed to handle JSON data and provides methods for loading JSON from a URL, converting JSON data to a structured format, and outputting JSON data.

Here's a brief overview of some key aspects of the class:

1. **Properties:**
   - `data`: This property is a `Collection` object that stores the parsed JSON data.

2. **Private Variables:**
   - Various private variables (`p_JSONstring`, `aj_in_string`, `aj_in_escape`, etc.) are used internally for parsing and processing JSON.

3. **Methods:**
   - `Class_Initialize` and `Class_Terminate`: These are special methods that run when an instance of the class is created (`Class_Initialize`) or destroyed (`Class_Terminate`).
   - `loadJSON`: Loads JSON data from a URL and processes it to populate the `data` property.
   - `Collection`: Creates and returns a new instance of a `Scripting.Dictionary`, serving as a collection object.
   - `AddToCollection`: Adds a new collection to a dictionary and returns the added collection.
   - `CleanUpJSONstring`: Cleans up the JSON string by removing unnecessary characters and formatting.
   - `getJSONValue`: Converts a JSON value to its corresponding VBScript data type.
   - `JSONoutput`: Outputs the structured JSON data as a string.
   - `GetDict`, `GetSubDict`, `WriteValue`: Helper functions for generating JSON output.

4. **Helper Functions:**
   - Several helper functions (`aj_JSONEncode`, `aj_JSONDecode`, `aj_InlineIf`, `aj_Strip`, `aj_MultilineTrim`, `aj_Trim`) are provided for encoding, decoding, and manipulating strings.

Overall, this class aims to provide functionality for working with JSON data in VBScript. Keep in mind that VBScript is an older scripting language, and more modern alternatives like JavaScript (for web-based scenarios) or PowerShell (for Windows scripting) are often preferred.
